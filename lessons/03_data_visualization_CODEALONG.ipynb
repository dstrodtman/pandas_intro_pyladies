    "\n",
    "First, you should read [this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-with-data-a-data-visualization-guide-for-business-professionals-97d50512b407), which gives a brief synopsis of some of the key points presented in [_Storytelling with Data: A Data Visualization Guide for Business Professionals_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119002257/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating good plots isn't easy, but it's worth the time and effort. Here's another fun [post that highlights some of the best and worst visualizations from 2018](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/02/best-worst-data-visualization-2018.html).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes we're seeking to just create a quick and dirty visualization to get a snapshot into our data. I think of these as _images_ rather than _plots_. My basic criteria for a visualization to be considered a plot are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It has a title.\n",
    "1. Axes are labeled.\n",
    "1. A legend is provided (if more than one color is used).\n",
    "1. The correct _type_ of plot was selected...\n",
    "1. ... to demonstrate a valid relationship.\n",
    "1. Interpretation and context are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the absolute bare minimum criteria. We should always try to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Give consideration to scale.\n",
    "1. Make all text legible for the intended presentation format.\n",
    "1. Eliminate redundant information.\n",
    "1. Where appropriate, order data to aid interpretability.\n",
    "1. Choose colors that are color-blind friendly AND clearly distinguishable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without going too deep, here are some things to always keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visual literacy, data literacy, technical literacy, and business acumen will vary drastically by audience. Make sure that you choose plotting methods that appropriate to the consumers of your visualizations.\n",
    "- Plots for written reports can be dense, and oftentimes may be provided to allow the audience to visually explore relationships of interest to them. Providing your own commentary on ALL plots will ensure that even if their interests in the data diverge from your own, they can quickly align themselves to why YOU feel the plot is important.\n",
    "- For presentations, your audience should be able to extract the core message from you plot in **3 seconds**. This allows your audience to focus on your stated message, rather than expending mental energy trying to figure out what you're trying to convey. Reducing clutter, using clear colors with high contrast, and formatting text to be visible from every seat in the meeting room are essential.\n",
    "- Colors vary _drastically_ on different monitors, TVs, and projectors. Additionally, colorblindness is fairly common, especially in men of European descent. You should do your best to choose colors that will be easily differentiable regardless of tehnology-based rendering problems or genetic differences."
