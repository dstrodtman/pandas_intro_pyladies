    "Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis often go hand in hand. \n",
    "- Without examining our data, it's difficult to know whether or not there are errors in it. \n",
    "- Without cleaning our data, our aggregate statistics may be skewed by errant data.\n",
    "The interplay of these processes is often very cyclical. For a data science workflow, these steps are essential to help us understand the nature of our data and ensure that we haven't injected or propogated unnecessary noise to our modeling algorithm. Oftentimes we will find ourselves circling back to data cleaning and EDA after modeling when we are dissatisfied with results.\n",

    "**No matter your goals working with data, becoming proficient with cleaning and EDA is amongst the most important skills you can learn.**\n",

    "By now, you're probably wondering:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Why do some of these things have `()`, some `[]`, and some no punctuation after the words?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've tried to explore Pandas independently, you may have given up in frustration, unable to troubleshoot the errors that you were getting trying to implement the solutions you found on StackOverflow. \n",
    "\n",
    "**You're not alone.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It will take time to familiarize yourself with the syntax for interacting with the Pandas application programming interface (API). In my experience, the biggest difficulty is learning that Pandas is _always trying to do the right thing_. Or rather, it's trying to do the thing it _thinks_ you might want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas was developed to bring the ease of data exploration and manipulation found in Excel, SQL, and R DataFrames into the Python environment. As such, there is a _ton_ of desired functionality that has been implemented by the open source community. Hopefully the following rules can help you begin to organize Pandas syntax in your mind. [(The official Pandas docs are always a good place to inform yourself)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/basics.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. When Accessing a Static Attribute, No Punctuation Is Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "A DataFrame is a `Class` object. You may or may not have worked with classes before; that's okay! An important thing to understand about a class is that it can store already computed static values (or attributes) that don't actually transform or operate on the data in anyway at time of access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples we've seen so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Syntax | Attribute accessed |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `.shape` | A tuple of the shape of the data, rows by columns |\n",
    "| `.index` | The index of the data, as an Index object |\n",
    "| `.columns` | The columns of the data, as an Index object |\n",
    "| `.T` | The transpose of the data, with rows as columns and columns as rows |\n",
    "| `.some_specific_column_name` e.g., `.fund_name` | A column series |\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these example, the returned attribute is just some aspect of the defined data that you're accessing. This will make a bit more sense after we consider...\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. When Modifying Data or Performing Calculations, Use `()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes also have associated methods. There are the same as functions, but can be thought of to generally have pre-defined arguments that act upon the data in the class. Thus far, most of the methods that we've invoked have _modified a preview of our data_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples we've seen so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Syntax | Method applied |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `.head()` | Limit returned view to first 5 rows |\n",
    "| `.sample()` | Return a random sample row from our data |\n",
    "| `.tolist()` | Return data as a list object |\n",
    "| `.info()` | Return a summary of indices, columns, dtypes, nulls, and size |\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other methods we'll see shortly extend common operations you may have encountered in SQL or numpy:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Syntax | Method applied |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `.groupby()` | Group by one or more columns |\n",
    "| `.count()` | Provide an aggregate count of rows |\n",
    "| `.mean()` | Calculate the mean of one or more columns |\n",
    "| `.join()` | Join a DataFrame with another DataFrame on some condition |\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas methods should always be used, when possible, as they're designed to be highly optimized for calculations, sorting, and aggregation. We'll learn many of these today, but there are far too many to cover in any one lesson (I still find new, useful methods regularly as complete projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**But what about those pesky square brackets?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. When Filtering or Accessing Data, Use `[]`\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a conceptual hurdle for some, but understanding square bracket notation really boils down to two main points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DataFrames are built on top of `numpy` arrays and extend much of the `numpy` notation.\n",
    "2. DataFrames can be thought of as a dictionary of `Series` and use dictionary indexing notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, neither of these concepts is helpful if you aren't familiar with keying into dictionaries and indexing in numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data is accessed by row(s) and then column(s)\n",
    "    - `df.loc[row]`\n",
    "    - `df.loc[row, column]`\n",
    "    - `df.loc[[row1, row2], [column1, column2]]`\n",
    "2. If no rows are passed, Pandas assumes you are trying to index into your columns\n",
    "    - `df[column]`\n",
    "    - `df[[column1, column2]]`\n",
    "    - `df.some_column_name` (not bracket notation, but the same concept)\n",
    "3. `:` can be used to select a range\n",
    "    - `df.loc[:, column]`\n",
    "    - `df.loc[0:5, column]`\n",
    "    - `df.loc[0:5, column1:column5]`\n",
    "4. Double brackets always return a DataFrame.\n",
    "    - `df[[column]]`\n",
    "    - `df[[column1, column2]]`\n",
    "    - `df.loc[[row1, row2], [column1, column2]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is a lot of information, and you're not expected to remember all of this right now**. One of the nice things about coding in Jupyter is that many of our error messages are informative, and we can often quickly add the punctuation needed to revise our code and get it to run. **The only way to learn is to try and fail**.\n"
